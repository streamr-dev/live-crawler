## Live crawler

Crawl Streamr network topologies on demand.

Crawling logic copied from https://github.com/streamr-dev/stream-metrics-index.

Consider this a prototype, TODO:
- tests
- ability to cancel requests
- configurability to different Streamr networks
- streaming results (for big streams)

## Install and run
```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000
